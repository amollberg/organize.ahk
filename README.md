# organize.ahk

Script in AutoHotkey that helps you to preview complex file moves before 
actually performing them. A .conf file can be written using natural English and
dragged-and-dropped onto organize.ahk or passed as a command-line argument 
as a substitute of the GUI.

See: www.autohotkey.com for the required runtime installation.
